## üîç SECURITY AND PRIVACY

- Never log personal or legal data (real or fake)
- Use `.env.example` for all secrets/configs
- Ensure encryption where applicable (AES-256 for files, hashed passwords)

---

## üìö DOCUMENTATION

You must update relevant documentation if:
- You add/remove an endpoint
- You change file/folder structure
- You alter data schemas or models
- You touch any compliance-related logic

Failing to update docs is grounds for PR rejection.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ABSOLUTE NO-GOs

- Commit secrets, keys, tokens ‚Äî you‚Äôll be blocked.
- Touching production (`main`) without approval.
- Writing AI prompt logic that hardcodes sensitive legal assumptions.
- Bypassing lint, type, or test checks with `--force` or `--no-verify`.

## üìû NEED HELP?

Ask in the team Slack channel or open a `question` issue. Don‚Äôt guess on legal logic or jurisdictional edge cases.
